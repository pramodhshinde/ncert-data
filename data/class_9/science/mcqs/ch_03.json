    "options": ["John Dalton", "Antoine Lavoisier", "J.J. Thomson", "Ernest Rutherford"],
    "correct_index": 1,
    "explanation": "The Law of Conservation of Mass was proposed by Antoine Lavoisier in 1789. It states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction — the total mass of reactants equals total mass of products.",

    "correct_index": 1,
    "explanation": "The symbol of Sodium is Na, derived from its Latin name 'Natrium'. Chemical symbols are internationally agreed upon and based on the element's name in English or Latin.",
