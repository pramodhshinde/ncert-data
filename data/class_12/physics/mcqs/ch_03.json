    "explanation": "Ohm's Law: V = IR. At constant temperature, the current (I) through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across it. The proportionality constant is resistance (R). Materials obeying Ohm's law are called ohmic conductors.",

    "explanation": "Resistivity (ρ) has SI unit of Ohm-metre (Ω·m). It is defined as R = ρL/A, where R is resistance, L is length, and A is cross-sectional area. Resistivity is a property of the material, not the shape.",

    "explanation": "Wheatstone bridge accurately measures an unknown resistance using a null method (no current through galvanometer). Balanced condition: P/Q = R/S, where P, Q, R are known resistances and S is unknown. High accuracy is achieved because it does not depend on meter readings.",
